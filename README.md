## Dynamic Data Structures

### VLCDequeSPSI class

[VLCDequeSPSI](https://github.com/TNishimoto/b_tree_plus_alpha/blob/main/include/prefix_sum/spsi.hpp) is a dynamic [prefix-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum "prefix-sum") data structure built on a non-negative integer sequence. 
This class is implemented using the technique in Section 2.2 of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jda.2018.11.002).
